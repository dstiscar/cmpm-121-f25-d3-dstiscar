# D3: World of Bits

## Game Design Vision

Click on a cell to collect its token value or swap it with yours. You can also combine your token value with a matching value.

## Technologies

- TypeScript for most game code, little to no explicit HTML, and all CSS collected in common `style.css` file
- Deno and Vite for building
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages for deployment automation

## Assignments

### D3.a: Core mechanics (token collection and crafting)

Key technical challenge: Can you assemble a map-based user interface using the Leaflet mapping framework?
Key gameplay challenge: Can players collect and craft tokens from nearby locations to finally make one of sufficiently high value?

#### Steps

- [x] copy main.ts to reference.ts for future reference
- [x] delete everything in main.ts
- [x] put a basic leaflet map on the screen
- [x] draw the player's location on the map
- [x] draw a rectangle representing one cell on the map
- [x] use loops to draw a whole grid of cells on the map
- [x] have cells display the value of the token they're carrying
- [x] add option to trade token to player
- [x] add text for whenever the player is carrying a token
- [x] add feature to combine tokens with matching value
- [x] signal the player if there are any tokens of matching value
